# YouTube Player Classicifier Extended

This repository contains two files that help make the YouTube player look like 2017 again!

It contains additional fixes since the original yt-player-classicifier doesn't get updated anymore

# Installation

For `yt_player_classicifier.user.css`, use Stylus ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)).

For `old_seek_ui.user.js`, use Tampermonkey ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)).

With both of these files, click them on GitHub and click the "Raw" button at the top of the code viewer. This should prompt the respective extensions to install these files.
